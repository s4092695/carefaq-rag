FAQs All ExpandedCollapse All What is a Telehealth session? A Telehealth session is a consultation where you and a clinician use technology to see and hear each other without being in the same room. Why use Telehealth? Telehealth reduces the need for travel to receive a consultation. It has been rapidly implemented since the COVID-19 pandemic to meet healthcare needs. How will I see the clinician if we are not in the same room? Videoconferencing is commonly used for Telehealth consultations. It's like a phone call but with video, so you can see the other participants. Can a family member attend the session with me? Yes, you can have a family member, carer, or support person attend the appointment with you. What happens in a Telehealth session? You will see your treating clinician on a screen. The clinician will be in a quiet office space during the consultation. Verbal consent is required at the start of your consultation. All staff involved will be introduced, and you will be asked to identify anyone else present. You/your carer can ask questions before, during, and after the consultation. Do I need a follow-up appointment? A follow-up appointment will be scheduled if needed. What if I don\u2019t want to be part of a Telehealth session? You can choose not to participate if you are uncomfortable. What if I am uncomfortable during the session? If you feel uncomfortable, speak with your clinician to address your concerns or ask to end the consultation. Are the sessions private and confidential? Yes, they are private and secure. They are not recorded. Documentation will be taken and entered into your medical record as usual. What if I need an interpreter?
