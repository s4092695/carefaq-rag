Your information
Health records of all patients treated in our health system are retained for their benefit. You can access your own health records at any time.

All health records we create at any of our facilities are confidential documents and remain the property of Canberra Health Services. We will not release copies of your health records to a third party without your written request and consent.

We take all steps necessary to ensure the privacy of your health information is secured. However, it’s important to note that if your GP or dentist’s clinic creates and has possession or control of your medical record, they are considered the record keeper. To access medical records held by a medical practitioner you will need to contact them directly.

You can also transfer a health record when your health service provider closes, merges with another or relocates.

Your Digital Health Record
We all have a Digital Health Record (DHR) to record all of our interactions with ACT public health services. This includes Canberra’s major public hospitals, community health centres and Walk-in Centres.

Your Digital Health Record will be used and managed by your health care team at any of our clinics, health centres or hospitals. This means it will be easier and faster for your treating team to get your information and they will have more time to focus on your care. You can read more about the Digital Health Record.
