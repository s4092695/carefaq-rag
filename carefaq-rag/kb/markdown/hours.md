Walk-in Centres provide free health care for non-life threatening injuries and illnesses to anyone who is over one year of age. They are part of the national network of Medicare Urgent Care Clinics.

The centres are open 7 days a week, including Christmas Day and New Year’s Day between 7.30am and 10pm. You don’t need to make an appointment, just come on in.

About this service
Walk-in Centres can provide you with a health assessment and treatment for a wide range of health needs including:

Who we care for

You do not need a Medicare card and all services are free.

How to access this service
You do not need an appointment or any referral; you can just walk in between 7.30am and 10pm and wait for your turn to be seen.

There is no need to call us. Our nurses see people face to face and cannot take phone calls.

What to expect
We provide care on a first come, first seen basis.

When you arrive at a Walk-in Centre please tell our reception staff why you need to be seen by a nurse. They’ll ask you for your name and other details before you will wait for your turn.

If you consent, we will send your GP a summary of your visit.
