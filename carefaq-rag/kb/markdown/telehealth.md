What is a Telehealth session?
A Telehealth session is a consultation where you and a clinician use technology to see and hear each other without being in the same room.
Why use Telehealth?
Telehealth reduces the need for travel to receive a consultation. It has been rapidly implemented since the COVID-19 pandemic to meet healthcare needs.
How will I see the clinician if we are not in the same room?
Videoconferencing is commonly used for Telehealth consultations. It's like a phone call but with video, so you can see the other participants.

Can a family member attend the session with me?

Do I need a follow-up appointment?

What if I donâ€™t want to be part of a Telehealth session?

What if I am uncomfortable during the session?
