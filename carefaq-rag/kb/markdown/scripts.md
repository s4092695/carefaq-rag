The process of leaving hospital is called discharge.

We want to make sure you are safe when you leave hospital and receive the care and support you need after your hospital stay.

You can talk with us at any time about any concerns or questions you have about leaving hospital.

Being discharged from hospital
You will be assessed to make sure it is safe for you to be discharged (leave hospital). There are a few other things that will happen before you leave hospital.

Medications and scripts
If your doctor has prescribed it, we will give you scripts for the medications you will need at home. We will talk to you about how and when to take any medications.

If you have been asked to pick up medication from the hospital pharmacy, don’t forget to stop there before you leave the hospital. We will make sure you have enough medicine for three business days, or until you can see your GP.

Medical/carers’ certificates
If you need a medical or carers certificate, please ask us for one before you leave hospital.

Important paperwork
You will be given a copy of your discharge report. If we have your permission, we will also send a copy to your GP. We may also give you:

written instructions for things you may need to remember, like what types of food or drink to have, or when to take your medications
details of any follow up appointments that have been made for you
contact information of someone who can help if you have problems or concerns once you leave hospital.
Getting home safely
It’s a good idea to plan how you will be getting home. If you need help making plans to get home or are worried about what happens when you are at home, we can help you.

Outpatient appointment
You may need to come to an outpatient appointment after your hospital stay. We will tell you about your appointment time by:

making your appointment before you leave hospital
contacting you once you are at home
sending you a letter with an appointment time.
