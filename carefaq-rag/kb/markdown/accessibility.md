We have designed this website to be as inclusive as possible and have aimed to make it accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of location, technology or ability.

This website conforms to Level AA (and in parts, AAA) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 2 (WCAG 2.0), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

The website is designed to display on all commonly used Internet browsers and to work effectively with accessibility hardware and/or software. To accommodate a range of connection speeds, page sizes have been kept to a minimum. Our web pages are scalable to accommodate various common screen resolutions.

While we have made this site as accessible as we can, you might have a better experience if you change the settings on your computer to suit your needs.

How to use ReadSpeaker's Listen Function
This website uses ReadSpeaker. ReadSpeaker allows the text on the website to be read out loud to you. It helps if you have trouble reading text online. The information on the website can be easier to understand if it is read out loud to you.

It makes the content more accessible and the website more pleasant to visit. As a user you don’t have to download anything.

How it works
To listen to the main content, simply click on the Listen icon at the top of each page and select a language. 

An audio player will appear and ReadSpeaker will start to read the text out loud. In the play, you can:

pause/restart the reading
stop the reading
use the progress bar to navigate in the audio
adjust the volume
click the settings icon to adjust the behavior of the service
click the download icon to download the audio file
close the player
You can use tab/shift+tab to navigate inside the player and press enter to activate a certain button or link.

To listen to selected text, select a part of the text that you want to listen to and then press the pop-up Listen button that appears next to the mouse pointer. When you click the pop-up Listen button, an audio player appears and ReadSpeaker starts reading the text you have selected.

In the settings menu, you can choose:

whether you want to have the text highlighted while read
whether you want the text highlighted on a word and sentence basis, sentence only, or word only
the style and colors for the highlighting
whether to display the current sentence at the bottom of the page, with a larger font size and simultaneous text highlighting
whether you want the reading speed to be slow, medium, or fast
whether you want the page to scroll automatically to follow the highlighted text
whether you want the pop-up Listen button to be shown when text is selected
to restore all settings to original defaults
You can also listen to the settings by clicking the Listen button at the top right of the Settings menu.
