What conditions are treatable at Walk-in Centres?
We provide advice and treatment for non-life-threatening injuries and illnesses.

What services are not offered by Walk-in Centres?
For serious illnesses or injuries requiring urgent attention, go to your nearest Emergency Department or call 000 for an ambulance.
Examples of conditions needing emergency care include:

severe breathing difficulties
loss of blood
head injuries
loss of consciousness
severe chest pains
severe allergic reactions.
What are your opening hours?
Our centres are open 7 days a week from 7.30am to 10pm. This includes all public holidays.

Where is my nearest Walk-in Centre?
We have Walk-in Centres located across Canberra.

We have directions to all of our Walk-in Centres.

How much does a visit cost?
Our centres offer free services. All costs are paid by the ACT Government.

What ages do you treat?
We treat patients from one year and older.

Can I see a doctor at the Walk-in Centre?
There are no doctors at our Walk-in Centres. If you have a medical condition that can’t be treated at the centre, our nurses will redirect you to the most appropriate health provider.

How long will I have to wait before being seen?
Waiting times depend on how many people are ahead of you in the queue. This can vary throughout the day. We publish approximate waiting times.

Can I make an appointment?
No. Our Walk-in Centres operate on a first-come, first-served basis.

Can I access the Walk-in Centres if I’m from another State or Territory?
Yes, our Walk-in Centres offer free health advice and treatment for minor injuries and illnesses to anyone who visits the centre.

If the nurse thinks I need to be redirected to an emergency department, can I skip the queue?
No. If you are redirected to the emergency department, you will need to be triaged and assessed by the medical and nursing professionals there.

What happens if I don’t get better?
If your symptoms don’t get better, please see your GP for further evaluation, advice and treatment.

Will my GP be notified of my visit?
A summary of your visit is sent to your nominated GP or medical centre. This will only happen if we have your permission.

What if I need urgent medical attention and an ambulance while I am at the Walk-in Centre?
Walk-in Centre staff will call an ambulance for you if you need medical attention during your visit. If this happens, you will be required to pay the account even if you did not ask for an ambulance. A cost will still apply if the ambulance attends but doesn’t transport you to hospital.

For more information, please see the ACT Ambulance Service.

Can I get a medical certificate for work?
Sick and carer certificates can inform your employer that you need leave because you are ill or injured or need to care for a family member who is ill or injured.

Employers can accept our certificates by law but may choose not to at their discretion.

Sick and carer certificates can only be offered at the time of your visit. We do not extend certificates for the same illness beyond the initial period. You should see your GP for further leave extensions.

Can you prescribe medications?
Nurses at the Walk-in Centres can supply some medications. Nurses are unable to change any medication prescribed by your doctor and cannot provide medications for chronic health conditions.

Do you stitch/suture wounds?
Walk-in Centre staff stitch or suture wounds depending on the size, depth and location of the wound. Walk-in Centre staff can also remove stitches.

I have a wound that I think is infected. Can you treat this?
Nurses at the Walk-in Centre can assess your wound and provide you with further advice. If required, you may be prescribed antibiotics.

Can you order X-rays?
Nurses at the Walk-in Centre can order X-rays for fingers, hands, wrists, lower arms, elbows, toes, feet, ankles, lower legs and knees if required. All other x-rays are unable to be ordered by nurses.
