Students in years 7 and 10 at government and non-government schools across the ACT, including homestay students.

Children who are home-schooled can access the free vaccines through their family doctor or participating pharmacy (a consultation fee may apply).

How to access this service
Year 7 students
Our Child and Adolescent Immunisation Team will visit Year 7 students once during the school year, in Term 3/4. Keep an eye out for the consent card which gets sent out in Term 3.

Find, sign and return it to the school - even if you do not consent for your child to receive these vaccines at school. Parent or guardian consent is required for Year 7 school vaccinations. If you can't find the consent card, ask your school for another one or download the Year 7 - Consent Card 2025 [PDF 3.57MB]. If you are printing the consent card, please print it on both sides (one piece of paper) in colour and provide this to your school, rather than scanning it.

Please read the information on the consent card carefully before you sign. Please complete and return a consent card even if you do not consent for your child to receive these vaccines at school.

Year 10 students
Year 10 students are offered a free meningococcal ACWY vaccine, which protects against four different strains of the meningococcal bacteria. One dose of the meningococcal ACWY vaccine is all that's required!

Keep an eye out for the consent card which gets sent out in Term 1. Find, sign and return it to the school.

Parent or guardian consent is required for Year 10 school vaccinations. If you can't find the consent card, ask your school for another one or download the Year 10 - Consent Card 2025 [PDF 12.92MB].

Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation
The Department of Health has released a series of vaccination videos for high school students and educators on vaccinations. The videos provide an overview on human papillomavirus (HPV), diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) and meningococcal disease, and what students can expect on the day.
